My primary research interests are exploring star and planet formation using multiwavelength data observed

								<b>Project I: Protostellar Jets and Outflows</b><br>Outflows and jets are the most intriguing characteristics of protostars during the accretion process.
								They remove excess angular momentum from the disk surface, allowing accreting material to fall onto the star surface. 
								The origin and characteristics are still unclear. High-resolution and high-sensitivity observations with ALMA in the submillimeter 
								wavelength provides a robust opportunity to explore the characteristics of the jets. Observations of statistically significant 
								jets allow drawing a comprehensive picture of the jet's characteristics. A few AU scale observations with higher velocity resolution 
								allow to measure jet rotation as well as jet-launching radius.
